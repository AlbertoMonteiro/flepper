# How to contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes.

## General feedback and discussions?
Please start a discussion on the [Home repo issue tracker](https://github.com/nicolastakashi/flepper/issues).

## Contributing code and content
Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Flepper team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

**Tests**

-  Tests need to be provided for every bug/feature that is completed.
-  If there is a scenario that is far too hard to test there does not need to be a test for it.
- "Too hard" is determined by the team as a whole.
